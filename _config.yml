  Ph.D. in Sociology and research data analyst at LCP Delta.
  <br><br>
  Passionate about Computational Social Science and applying machine learning to this domain. I'm interested in using remote sensing data to explain and tackle social issues.
  Further, I use various statistical methods such as time-series analysis in combination with different types of data to examine social phenomena such as poverty, environmental concern, and life satisfaction.
  As a research data analyst at LCP Delta, I'm responsible for building high-quality data deliverables by using primary and secondary data sources. This enables the service teams to provide precious information regarding regulations and the market potential of selected energy-related technologies to clients.
