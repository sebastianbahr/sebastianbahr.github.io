  Ph.D. student in Sociology and data analyst / scientist with 3 years of commercial experience in a tech startup.
  <br><br>
  Passionated about Computational Social Science and applying machine learning to this domain. I'm interested in using remote sensing data to explain and tackle social issues.
  Further, I use a variety of statistical methods as time-series analysis in combination with different types of data to examine social phenomenas as e.g. poverty and environmental concern.
  As a data analyst / scientist I'm responsible for business analytics, communicating findings to internal and external stakeholders, user-segmentation analysis with unsupervised ML, and the
  development of a recommender engine and features like a chatbot and a content enhancer using LLMs and prompt engineering.
